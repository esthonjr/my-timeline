# 🧭 About This Repository

I'm gradually restoring and recreating projects that were part of my journey. This index is, therefore, a living archive: ever-evolving and always in motion.

For many years, I didn’t have the habit of publishing my work to GitHub, and much of it remained offline. Now, little by little, I'm bringing those pieces back — restoring, refactoring, or rebuilding them when needed.

This timeline brings together programming projects spanning past and present, covering a variety of languages, paradigms, and phases of my growth as a developer. Each project represents a concrete step in learning, experimentation, or professional development.

More than just code, this timeline reflects a **mindset evolution**:  
curiosity → structure → practice → creativity → AI integration.

It’s a reminder that every small step contributes to building a solid and meaningful journey.

# 🧪 How Projects Are Organized

- **By decade**: Grouped chronologically to reflect the technologies common in each era.  
- **By language**: Each project uses tools I had access to or was learning at the time.  
- **By intent**: Some are study cases, some prototypes, others reached production use.

# 🚧 Important Notes

- Some projects are incomplete or were created as quick exercises.  
- Many older codebases don’t follow modern best practices, but are kept for historical accuracy.  
- Technologies used reflect what was available at the time, even if now outdated.
