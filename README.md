# üß≠ About This Repository

I'm gradually restoring and recreating projects that were part of my journey. This index is, therefore, a living archive: ever-evolving and always in motion.

For many years, I didn‚Äôt have the habit of publishing my work to GitHub, and much of it remained offline. Now, little by little, I'm bringing those pieces back ‚Äî restoring, refactoring, or rebuilding them when needed.

This timeline brings together programming projects spanning past and present, covering a variety of languages, paradigms, and phases of my growth as a developer. Each project represents a concrete step in learning, experimentation, or professional development.

More than just code, this timeline reflects a **mindset evolution**:  
curiosity ‚Üí structure ‚Üí practice ‚Üí creativity ‚Üí AI integration.

It‚Äôs a reminder that every small step contributes to building a solid and meaningful journey.

# üß™ How Projects Are Organized

- **By decade**: Grouped chronologically to reflect the technologies common in each era.  
- **By language**: Each project uses tools I had access to or was learning at the time.  
- **By intent**: Some are study cases, some prototypes, others reached production use.
